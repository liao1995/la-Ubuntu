1
00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:05,058
In this video, I'm gonna tell you a little
bit about real neurons on the real brain

2
00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:10,046
which provide the inspiration for the
artificial neural network that we're gonna

3
00:00:10,046 --> 00:00:14,094
learn about in this course.
In most of the course, we won't talk much

4
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:20,085
about real neurons but I wanted to give
you a quick overview of the beginning.

5
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:26,097
There's several different reasons to study
how networks of neurons can compute

6
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:29,059
things.
The first is to understand how the brain

7
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:34,036
actually works.
You might think we could do that just by

8
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:38,041
experiments on the brain.
But it's very big and complicated, and it

9
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:42,081
dies when you poke it around.
And so we need to use computer simulations

10
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:46,085
to help us understand what we're
discovering in empirical studies.

11
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:52,016
The second is to understand the style of
parallel computation, this inspired by the

12
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:56,727
fact that the brain can compute with a big
parallel network, a world of relatively

13
00:00:56,727 --> 00:00:59,080
slow neurons.
If you can understand that style of

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,013
parallel computation we might be able to
make better parallel computers.

15
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:08,039
It's very different from the way
computation is done on a conventional

16
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:11,076
serial processor.
It should be very good for things that

17
00:01:11,076 --> 00:01:16,057
brains are good at like vision, and it
should also be bad for things that brains

18
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:19,040
are bad at by multiplying two numbers
together.

19
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:25,037
A third reason, which is the relevant one
for this course, is to solve practical

20
00:01:25,037 --> 00:01:29,065
problems by using novel learning
algorithms that were inspired by the

21
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:32,052
brain.
These algorithms can be very useful even

22
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:35,021
if they're not actually how the brain
works.

23
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:40,011
So in most of this course we won't talk
much about how the brain actually works.

24
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:45,012
It's just used as a source of inspiration
to tell us the big, parallel networks of

25
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:47,081
neurons can compute very complicated
things.

26
00:01:49,037 --> 00:01:55,002
I'm gonna talk more in this video though
about how the brain actually works.

27
00:01:55,002 --> 00:02:01,003
A typical cortical neuron has a gross
physical structure that consists of a cell

28
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:06,090
body, and an axon where it sends messages
to other neurons, and a denditric tree

29
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,031
where it receives messages from other
neurons.

30
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:16,019
Where an axon from one neuron contacts a
dendritic tree of another neuron, there's

31
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:22,027
a structure called a synapse.
And a spike of activity traveling along

32
00:02:22,027 --> 00:02:29,009
the axon, causes charge to be injected
into the post synaptic neuron at a

33
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:33,072
synapse.
A neuron generates spikes when it's

34
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:39,031
received enough charge in its dendritic
tree to depolarize a part of the cell body

35
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:43,075
called the axon hillock.
And when that gets depolarized, the neuron

36
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:48,006
sends a spike out along its axon.
And the spike's just a wave of

37
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:50,096
depolarization that travels along the
axon.

38
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:57,046
Synapses themselves have interesting
structure.

39
00:02:57,046 --> 00:03:01,071
They contain little vesicles of
transmitter chemical and when a spike

40
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:07,011
arrives in the axon it causes these
vesicles to migrate to the surface and be

41
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:11,039
released into the synaptic cleft.
There's several different kinds of

42
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,024
transmitter chemical.
There's one that implement positive

43
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:17,053
weights and ones that implement negative
weights.

44
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:22,073
The transmitter molecules diffuse across
the synaptic clef and bind to receptor

45
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:26,041
molecules in the membrane of the
post-synaptic neuron, and by binding to

46
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:31,040
these big molecules in the membrane they
change their shape, and that creates holes

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,043
in the membrane.
These holes are like specific ions to flow

48
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:41,018
in or out of the post-synaptic neuron and
that changes their state of

49
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:46,092
depolarization.
Synapses adapt, and that's what most of

50
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:50,052
learning is, changing the effectiveness of
a synapse.

51
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:56,007
They can adapt by varying the number of
vesicles that get released when a spike

52
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:59,019
arrives.
Or by varying the number of receptor

53
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,084
molecules that are sensitive to the
released transmitter molecules.

54
00:04:04,046 --> 00:04:07,097
Synapses are very slow compared with
computer memory.

55
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:13,014
But they have a lot of advantages over the
random access memory on a computer,

56
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:17,086
they're very small and very low power.
And they can adapt.

57
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:22,003
That's the most important property.
They use locally available signals to

58
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:26,077
change their strengths, and that's how we
learn to perform complicated computations.

59
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:31,045
The issue of course is how do they decide
how to change their strength?

60
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:34,093
What is the, what are the rules for how
they should adapt.

61
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:39,035
So, all on one slide this is how the brain
works.

62
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:42,051
Each neuron receives inputs from other
neurons.

63
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:46,022
A few of the neurons receive inputs from
the receptors.

64
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:50,059
It's a large number of neurons, but only a
small fraction of them.

65
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:55,028
And, the neurons communicate with each
other within in the cortex by sending

66
00:04:55,028 --> 00:05:01,005
these spikes of activity.
The effective in input line on a neuron is

67
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:05,017
controlled by synaptic weight, which can
be positive or negative.

68
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:09,087
And these synaptic weights adapt.
And by adapting these weights the whole

69
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:12,090
network learns to perform different kinds
of computation.

70
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,040
For example recognizing objects,
understanding language, making plans,

71
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:23,037
controlling the movements of your body.
You have about ten to the eleven neurons,

72
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:26,056
each of which has about ten to the four
weights.

73
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:31,056
So you probably ten to the fifteen or
maybe only about ten to the fourteen

74
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:35,043
synaptic weights.
And a huge number of these weights, quite

75
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:40,049
a large fraction of them, can affect the
ongoing computation in a very small

76
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:43,036
fraction of a second, in a few
milliseconds.

77
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:48,069
That's much better bandwidth to stored
knowledge than even a modern workstation

78
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:52,071
has.
One final point about the brain is that

79
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:56,045
the cortex is modular, at least it learns
to be modular.

80
00:05:56,045 --> 00:06:00,039
Different bits of the cotex end up doing
different things.

81
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:05,032
Genetically, the inputs from the senses go
to different bits of the cortex.

82
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,099
And that determines a lot about what they
end up doing.

83
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:14,019
If you damage the brain of an adult, local
damage to the brain causes specific

84
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:17,032
effects.
Damage to one place might cause you to

85
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:22,092
lose your ability to understand language.
Damage to another place might cause you to

86
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:29,045
lose your ability to recognize objects.
We know a lot about how functions are

87
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:34,057
located in the brain because when you use
a part of the brain for doing something it

88
00:06:34,057 --> 00:06:39,046
requires energy, and so it demands more
blood flow, and you can see the blood flow

89
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:43,008
in a brain scanner.
That allows you to see which bits of the

90
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:48,083
brain you're using for particular tasks.
But the remarkable thing about cortex is

91
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:53,090
it looks pretty much the same all over,
and that strongly suggests that it's got a

92
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,005
fairly flexible universal learning
algorithm in it.

93
00:06:57,005 --> 00:07:01,058
That's also suggested by the fact that if
you damage the brain early on, functions

94
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:07,056
will relocate to other parts of the brain.
So it's not genetically predetermined, at

95
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:12,048
least not directly, which part of the
brain will perform which function.

96
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:18,009
There's convincing experiments on baby
ferrets that show that if you cut off the

97
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:23,050
input to the auditory cortex that comes
from the ears, and instead, reroute the

98
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:29,025
visual input to auditory cortex, then the
auditory cortex that was destined to deal

99
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:34,094
with sounds will actually learn to deal
with visual input, and create neurons that

100
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:38,048
look very like the neurons in the visual
system.

101
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:45,026
This suggest the cortex is made of general
purpose stuff that has the ability to turn

102
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:48,094
into special purpose hardware for
particular tasks in response to

103
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:52,050
experience.
And that gives you a nice combination of,

104
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:58,025
rapid parallel computation once you have
learnt, plus flexibility, so you can put,

105
00:07:58,025 --> 00:08:03,093
you can learn new functions, so you are
learning, to do the parallel computation.

106
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:09,068
Its quiet like a FPGA, where you build
standard parallel hardware, then after its

107
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:15,094
built, you put in information that tells
it what particular parallel computation to

108
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:19,005
do.
Conventional computers get their

109
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:21,097
flexibility by having a stored sequential
program.

110
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:26,031
But this required very fast central
processors to access the lines in the

111
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:29,093
sequential program and perform long
sequential computations.
